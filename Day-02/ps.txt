Find the Missing Number

You are given an array arr containing n-1 distinct integers. The array consists of integers taken from the range 1 to n, meaning one integer is missing from this sequence. Your task is to find the missing integer.

Input:
An integer array arr of size n-1 where the elements are distinct and taken from the range 1 to n.
Example : arr = [1, 2, 4, 5]

Output:
Return the missing integer from the array.
Example: Missing number: 3

Constraints:
The array contains exactly n-1 distinct integers, and all integers are in the range [1, n].
You must solve the problem with a time complexity of O(n).
The space complexity should be O(1) (constant space).
1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6

Test Cases:
Test Case 1
Input: [1, 2, 4, 5]
Output: 3
Test Case 2:
Input: [2, 3, 4, 5]
Output: 1
Test Case 3:
Input: [1, 2, 3, 4]
Output: 5
Test Case 4:
Input: [1]
Output: 2
Test Case 5:
Input: [1, 2, 3, ..., 999999]
Output: 1000000

Edge Cases:
The smallest possible array where n = 2. The missing number can only be 1 or 2.
The largest possible array where n = 10^6.
